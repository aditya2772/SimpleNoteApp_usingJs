# SimpleNoteApp_usingJs
# in this project i am using some DOM methods, eventListners, localStorage properties, foreach loop.
# in this simple project i created a cards using bootstrap and you can enter any note in that card it will add that card sequentially.
# the data of that cards stored in local storage if you refresh the page data doesnt lost but if you close the site and open it again then data will lost and cards dissappers
